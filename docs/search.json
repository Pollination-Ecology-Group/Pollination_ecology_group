Pausas is a CSIC Research Professor at Centro de Investigaci√≥n sobre Desertificaci√≥n (CIDE, Valencia, Spain) of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). His research focuses on ecology and evolution of mediterranean and fire-prone ecosystems, and specifically on understanding the role of fire in shaping populations, species (i.e., fire traits), communities (i.e., assembly processes), landscapes, and biomes. While his primary experience is in Mediterranean ecosystems, he possesses a broad, global perspective on ecology. He has participated in several successful international research projects and has experience in both field and modelling studies. He has written more than 200 scientific papers, co-edited an international book on theecology of Cork oak woodlands (Island Press), co-authored a book on Fire ecology in Mediterranean ecosystems (Cambridge Press), and book in Spanish on fire ecology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCristina Bot√≠as is a Ram√≥n y Cajal Research Fellow at the University of Alcal√°. She holds a PhD in Veterinary Science from the Complutense University of Madrid, completed at the Apicultural and Agri-environmental Research Center (CIAPA‚ÄìIRIAF), where she studied the effects of honeybee pathogens at both individual and colony levels. Her doctoral work, awarded the PhD Extraordinary Prize, provided key insights into how emerging diseases affect bee health and colony performance. Following her PhD, Cristina conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Sussex (UK), investigating pesticide exposure and its interactions with other stressors, such as pathogens. Her findings highlighted that bees are exposed to higher and more prolonged pesticide levels than previously thought. She later held a Juan de la Cierva Fellowship at the Estaci√≥n Biol√≥gica de Do√±ana‚ÄìCSIC, focusing on disease pressures in wild bees, and subsequently returned to CIAPA‚ÄìIRIAF with an INIA-DOC fellowship to continue her research on wild pollinator health. Since 2022, she has been based at the University of Alcal√°, where her research focuses on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of pathogens affecting bumblebees and other pollinators. She also teaches undergraduate courses in Zoology and Sanitary Entomology within the degrees of Environmental Sciences, Biology, and Sanitary Biology. Cristina has published over 50 scientific articles and led several research projects funded by regional, national and international bodies. She is also active in outreach efforts, promoting awareness of pollinators‚Äô ecological importance and the threats they face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo workshops will be held on Wednesday 11th February from 15:00 to 18:00. Please indicate your interest in attending one of them in the registration form. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNesting traps simulate nesting resources for a wide diversity of bees and wasps. They are useful to standardize sampling and sample a lot of sites simultaneously. However, nesting traps can be designed in multiple ways, and their use and effectiveness is dependent on the scientific questions addressed as well as in the knowledge of the natural history of bees and wasps. In this workshop we will provide basic knowledge on the biology and ecology of cavity-nesting bees and wasps, and we will provide specific recommendations on which materials to use and how to install them to assure replicability and effectiveness of sampling.\nInstructors: J√∫lia Batlle-Benaiges, JJ√∫lia Coromina, Carlos Hern√°ndez-Castellano\nTime: Wednesday 11th February, 10:00 - 13:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant-pollinator systems are essential to sustain biodiversity and function in ecosystems. Indeed, they are one of the main research topics in the ECOFLOR community, and include, among others, the study of the evolution of breeding systems, pollination ecology, spatio-temporal variation in pollinator communities, and ecological networks. In a context of global change, the scientific community is adapting continuously to research and management challenges imposed by the need to reverse negative impacts and restore the integrity of ecosystems. In this workshop, we want to organize a Horizon Scan to identify research and management priorities in plant-pollinator systems research in Mediterranean ecosystems for the next decade. This will be conducted within the ECOFLOR community and will yield a multi-authored, collaborative paper, published in a scientific journal related to the research topic.\nInstructors: Carlos Hern√°ndez-Castellano, Ignasi Bartomeus\nTime: Wednesday 11th February, 10:00 - 13:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe field trip will take place on Saturday 14th February, visiting the Ports Natural Parks (a mountain range affected by a recent wildfire) and the Delta (an area of aquatic ecosystems and ecosystem restoration). More details will be provided to registered participants.\n\n\n\nWelcome to TORTOSA!\nThe 23rd edition of EcoFlor takes place at the Centre C√≠vic Ferreries. This historical building (ancient market) is located in the city center of Tortosa.\nOral Presentations (including plenary talks) will take place in the Main Hall.\nPosters will be in the room next to the Main Hall.\nWorkshops will be conducted in‚Ä¶\nThere are up to three spaces (two small meeting rooms, one big hall with panoramic view to the Main Hall) upstairs. Consider this if you need to work some time or to meet with colleagues. You could book the room some period of time by 1) mailing to the organization, or 2) writing it in the room schedule (blank paper in the door).\n\n\nFor those coming from abroad and landing at Barcelona airport, it is easy to reach Tortosa, since there is a direct bus (Hife company) connection with departures every hour, taking about 2 hours to reach Tortosa. Remember to buy the ticket with anticipation. Consider that you can also get the bus (Hife) from several bus stops in Barcelona, with direct connections to Tortosa. From the Tortosa bus station, it is approximately fifteen minutes walk to the venue.\nIf you are already in Barcelona, you may get the train R16 from Sants Train Station operated by the Renfe company. Departures are approximately every 1-2 hours, taking about 2 hours. From the Tortosa main train station, it is approximately ten minutes walk to the venue.\nFor those coming in car (e.g.¬†Spain), just get the exit number 40 in the AP-/ railway.\nIf you find any problem, contact the ECOFLOR organization committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 23rd edition of EcoFlor meeting is organised by the Wildlife Pollinators Group, a research group of the Wildlife Ecology and Health Lab, based in the Veterinary Faculty of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). Additional researchers from different institutions (IRTA, CTFC, IVIA, CREAF) are actively involved in the organisation.\nIn the Wildlife Pollinators Group we study the relationship between large herbivores (domestic and wild) and plant-pollinator communities and interactions,as well as in pollination function. We are also interested in understanding how other processes operating at large scales (such as wildfires) influence the assemblage of these communities. On the opposite (microscopic scale) side, we are interested in disentangling the mysteries behind solitary bee health. We conduct basic faunistic studies as well as research on bee diversity patterns in multiple types of habitats (including urban ecosystems, riparian ecosystems, and grasslands).\n\n\nOrganizing committee: Carlos Hern√°ndez-Castellano, N√©stor P√©rez-M√©ndez, Jordi Margalef-Marrass√©, Alice Casiraghi, Alice Casiraghi, Marina Aguilar, J√∫lia Batlle-Benaiges, JJ√∫lia Coromina, Nil Guerrero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral researcher at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (Department of Medicine, Veterinary Faculty), currently based at the Czech University of Life Sciences (Prague, Czech Republic).
